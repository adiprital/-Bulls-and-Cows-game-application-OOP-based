# -Bulls-and-Cows-game-application-OOP-based
An application which get an input from the user of a number with 4 different digits, while a number with 4 different digits is randomized by the program.
The user's goal is to guess the randomized number, and he will keep guessing until the number is detected.
In each iteration of the game, the user will be shown his previous guesses and the amount of bulls and cows in each guess.
"Bulls" - when the matching digits are in their right positions.
"Cows" - if the matching digits are exists in the randomized number, but in different positions.
For exmaple:
Randomized number - 1025
User's guess - 1853
1 bull and 1 cow ('1' is a bull, and '5' is a cow).
The game will end when the user manages to guess 4 BULLS, meaning the randomized number has been discovered.
